            <p class="article">Sometimes a feeling is all we humans have to go on. Leave bigotry in your quarters; there's no room for it on the bridge. Compassion: that's the one things no machine ever had. Maybe it's the one thing that keeps men ahead of them. Change is the essential process of all existence. Human beings do not survive on bread alone ... but on the nourishments of liberty. For what indeed is a man without freedom ... naught but a mechanism, trapped in the cogwheels of eternity. Look at these three words written larger than all the rest, and with special pride never written before or since -- tall words, proudly saying "We the people" ... these words and the words that follow ... must apply to everyone or they mean nothing.</p>

            <p class="article">Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir; Those his goodly eyes, That o'er the files and musters of the war Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn, The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st, charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there begins my sadness.  This is no place; this house is but a butchery; Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it. No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess, Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow.   Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but that they call compliment is like th' encounter of two dog-apes; and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks have given him a penny, and he renders me the beggarly thanks.  And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to  whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.  A miserable world!  As I do live by food, I met a fool, Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun, And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms, In good set terms- and yet a motley fool.   Not see him since! Sir, sir, that cannot be.  B</p>
